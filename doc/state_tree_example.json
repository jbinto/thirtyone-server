// This is an example of a state tree for the card game 31.
//
// The intention is to implement a reducer for this with Redux, 
// one on the server side for global game state (Node/Socket.io). 
//
// A modified client state would be sent to each player, and
// rendered in the browser (React/Socket.io).
//
// Disclaimer: Pretty new to functional programming. Will take
// some time to get over OO. Need to read the Redux docs and
// examples a bit more.
